# C++ SFML Games Repository
A collection of small games that I created while learning the basics of SFML as a fun C++ exercise

## Game Descriptions
### Game 1
A game where the player clicks falling cubes before they reach the bottom to earn points and prevent health loss

### Game 2
A game where the player collects various-sized balls, gaining points for regular ones and facing damaging or healing effects from different balls based on their size. The objective is to sustain health and accumulate points until health depletes, ending the game.
